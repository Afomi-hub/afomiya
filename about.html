      <h1>About me</h1> 
      <h3>I am Afomiya Fikadu who follows the dreams of an artist and reflects the nature of a dreamer. I draw my creative inspiration from the Ethiopian countryside as I convert my surrounding emotions into artwork to share stories through my artwork. I view art as my deep love and visual means to share ideas which transcend verbal language.

Spending time in slumber serves as my favorite hobby between artistic projects. My imagination finds its power to wander by experiencing rest which stimulates my creative process. The book Jacqueline by Agatha Christie serves as my life-long favorite among novels which I enjoy reading.
           </h3>
